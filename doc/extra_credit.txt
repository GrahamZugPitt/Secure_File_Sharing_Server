Phase 4

We created a integration testing script to automate our previously manual testing of user input
after changes to our code base.

To run the tests, make sure you are in the main directory: cs1653-project-null/

ant compile
cd test
bash run_integration_tests.sh

Should you have any failures, you can check the output.test file to see where they occurred and what the user would have seen.



------------------------
Phase 2

We created a GUI using JavaFX to be used as a User Client.
This is much simpler to use than the terminal version.

---------------
--Compilation--
---------------
Compilation requires the latest version of JavaFX downloaded from: https://openjfx.io/

Let $PATH_TO_FX := Path to the \lib folder of JavaFX

copy the file:
	"/extra-credit/user/javafx/FXMLDocument.fxml"
to the directory: 
	"/dist/user/javafx/"

javac --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -sourcepath extra-credit -d dist -cp dist extra-credit/*.java
