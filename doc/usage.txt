FileSharing Usage Information
Execute all commands in the build/ directory.

USAGE:
 To start the Group Server from the console: java -cp [BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR_PATH] RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server will by default
 run on a random port, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.
 
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.

 To start the File Server from the console enter: java -cp [BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR_PATH] RunFileServer  [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files directory inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online.  The file server will by default
 run on a random port, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
